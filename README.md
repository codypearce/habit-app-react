# Simple Habit App React
A simple habit app built on React. Can add, edit, and delete habits. Each habit has a block for each day, you click a block to change the status of that block for that day and it cycles throught the statuses. Green is success, red is failure, purple is skipping that habit that day, and grey is no data for that habit that day.
